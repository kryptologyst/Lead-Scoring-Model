# Lead Scoring Model

A comprehensive machine learning-powered lead scoring system that predicts the likelihood of lead conversion using behavioral and demographic data.

## Overview

This project implements a lead scoring model that helps sales and marketing teams prioritize leads based on their conversion probability. The system uses machine learning algorithms to analyze various factors including demographics, engagement metrics, and behavioral patterns to assign scores from 0-100.

## Features

- **Machine Learning Model**: Random Forest classifier with cross-validation
- **Web Interface**: Modern Flask-based UI for easy lead management
- **Real-time Scoring**: Instant lead score calculation with actionable insights
- **Analytics Dashboard**: Comprehensive model performance metrics and visualizations
- **Data Export**: CSV export functionality for external analysis
- **Mock Database**: Realistic synthetic data for testing and demonstration
- **Model Persistence**: Automatic model saving and loading
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly Bootstrap interface

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip package manager

### Installation

1. **Clone or download the project**
   ```bash
   cd 0057_Lead_scoring_model
   ```

2. **Create virtual environment** (recommended)
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

5. **Open your browser**
   Navigate to `http://localhost:5000`

## Lead Scoring Categories

The system categorizes leads into four categories based on their scores:

- **üî• Hot (80-100)**: High conversion probability - immediate follow-up recommended
- **üå°Ô∏è Warm (60-79)**: Good conversion potential - targeted nurturing needed
- **‚ùÑÔ∏è Cold (40-59)**: Moderate interest - continue with regular nurturing
- **üßä Ice Cold (0-39)**: Low conversion likelihood - long-term nurturing

## Features Used for Scoring
